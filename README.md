## Developer's site: [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com)

This code is an example of how the Multi Timeframe Moving Average (MA) indicator works. The purpose of this indicator is to analyze the moving average values of multiple timeframes and identify potential cross-overs.

### Indicator Parameters

- **Number_of_MAs**: The number of moving averages to calculate (default: 3).
- **MA_Type**: The type of moving average to use (default: Simple Moving Average).
- **MA_Period1**: The period of the first moving average (default: 5).
- **MA_Timeframe1**: The timeframe of the first moving average (default: 15 minutes).
- **MA_Period2**: The period of the second moving average (default: 10).
- **MA_Timeframe2**: The timeframe of the second moving average (default: 1 hour).
- **MA_Period3**: The period of the third moving average (default: 20).
- **MA_Timeframe3**: The timeframe of the third moving average (default: 4 hours).

### Indicator Initialization

The indicator initializes by setting up the MA buffers and labels. The MA buffers are used to store the calculated moving average values for each timeframe. The MA labels are used to display the parameters of each moving average on the chart.

### Indicator Calculation

The indicator iterates through the price data and calculates the moving average values for each timeframe. It also checks for potential cross-overs between the moving averages.

If the current moving average value is greater than the previous moving average value and the previous moving average value is less than the current moving average value, an alert is triggered indicating a cross-over.
